        A Back-End Developer is the mastermind behind the scenes, creating the core computational logic that powers websites and applications. They design and manage the technology that ensures all components of a web or mobile application work seamlessly. If the front-end is what users see, the back-end is the hidden engine that drives everything.

Back-End Developers are critical for building applications that scale, perform efficiently, and handle data securely.
