        <div class="enhance">To make the website more attractive and lively, we will add animation effects to the elements on the job page. This will make it more interesting for users as they browse through the jobs, such as a fade-in effect when the page loads or a hover effect when the user hovers over a job listing, making it appear larger or giving it a smooth transition. At the same time, to enhance the user experience and make it more accessible, we need to create three separate pages for each job in the list, such as one page dedicated to the Back-End Developer, another for the Data Scientist, and finally, a page for the Full-Stack Developer. Each page will contain detailed descriptions of the job, required skills, and career opportunities, helping users better understand each position and decide which job is right for them.</div>
