        <div class="enhance">To make the website more attractive and lively, we will add animation effects to the elements on the job page. 
            This will make it more interesting for users as they browse through the jobs, 
            such as a fade-in effect when the page loads or a hover effect when the user hovers over a job listing,
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_keyframes.php">(Example)</a>
            making it appear larger or giving it a smooth transition. At the same time, to enhance the user experience and make it more accessible, 
            we need to create three separate pages for each job in the list, such as one page dedicated to the <a href="back-end-description.html">Back-end Developer</a>, 
            another for the <a href="data-sci-description.html">Data Scientist</a> and finally, a page for the <a href="fullstack-dev-description.html">Full-Stack Developer</a>by hyperlinking the others HTML files through buttons. 
            Each page will contain more detailed descriptions of the job, 
            required skills, and career opportunities, helping users better understand each position and decide which job is right for them. 
            This could be seen as an enhancement from the basic requirement of only have a few basic information about the jobs. And as for the requirement, these enhancements can run on FireFox quite smoothly.
            Futhermore, We also implement a small animation for the buttons that are used in the  <a href="index.html">main page</a> and the <a href="jobs.html">jobs page</a> with the effect can be seen when a user's mouse hover over the button.
             This effect can be achieved with border radius command in css. We would leave the border radius as 0 in normal setting and set it to the same radius as the other corners when is hovered. The effect can be seemless for user and create a more interactive experience.</div>
